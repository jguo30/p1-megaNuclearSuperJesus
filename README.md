# P01: ArRESTed Development by megaNuclearSuperJesus
## Roster: Jacob Guo (PM), Marc Jiang (Database Engineer), Sam Cowan (API Tamer/Flask Incorporator), Nicole Zhou (Foundation Magician)

### Description
- Our project is an College picker, which is an API based website that offers weather/climate of that region, commute or travel to that location, and other special long run goals.

- The purpose is mainly to help a high school senior prepare for their first year of college, helping explain logistics of getting to and from college, etc

### Launch Codes
1. Navigate in your terminal to the directory in which you would like to store the College Picker using 
```cd```
2. Clone the repository to your local file system by entering 
<br>```git clone git@github.com:jguo30/p1-megaNuclearSuperJesus.git```
3. Navigate into the repo. Keep in mind that you can use tab to autocomplete for many cd commands (or c/p)
<br>```cd p1-megaNuclearSuperJesus/```
4. Create a virtual environment (you can do this anywhere but the following instruction are for creating it inside of the repo: 
<br>```python3 -m venv <VENV_NAME>```
5. NOTE: writing `python` instead of `python3` will work on lab machines but the alias is not necessarily on other computers; I would recommend using `python3`because of this
6. Enter the virtual environment folder<br>
```cd <VENV_NAME>```
7. Activate your venv with 
```
(Linux)
. bin/activate

(Windows Command Prompt)
Scripts\activate.bat
```
8. Install requirements with 
```
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```
9. Type 
```
python3 __init__.py
```
10. Open the link prompted in the terminal with browser of choice!
